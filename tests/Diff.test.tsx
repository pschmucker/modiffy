The only issue I had was the development and backstory behind each of the main characters, which I feel could\'ve been handled a bit better. This film is definitely not going to be everyone\'s cup of tea when it comes to pacing, but I personally liked that it took its time and had no issue with it. Dune is easily one of the best films I have seen in a long time and in terms of scale and epicness it is right up there with Lord of the Rings.' } ], details: { releaseDate: '2021-10-22T00:00:00.000Z' } }} />);
